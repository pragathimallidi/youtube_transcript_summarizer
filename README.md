# YouTube Transcript Summarizer

This project makes it easy to get a quick summary of any YouTube video without watching the whole thing. It works by taking the transcript of a video (if available) and using AI to generate a short, easy-to-read summary. This way, you can save time and still understand the main points of long videos.

## What it does
* Takes a YouTube video link
* Finds and extracts the transcript (if the video has one)
* Breaks it into smaller parts if the video is long
* Summarizes everything into a short version with the key ideas

## Why itâ€™s useful
* Saves time by avoiding long videos
* Great for students, researchers, or anyone learning from YouTube
* Helps content creators quickly check what a video is about
* Makes it easier to review key points later

## How to use
1. Clone the repository and install the required libraries
2. Run the script or web app
3. Paste a YouTube video link
4. Get the transcript and summary instantly

## Example

Input:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Output:
Summary: The video talks about staying motivated, being consistent, and focusing on goals...

## Future improvements
* Better handling of very long videos
* Option to choose summary length (short or detailed)
* Export summaries to text or PDF
